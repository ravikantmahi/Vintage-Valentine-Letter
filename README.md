### 📖 About The Project

**Vintage-Valentine-Letter** is a web experience designed to feel like a keepsake from the 19th century. Moving away from modern flashy designs, this project focuses on **texture, emotion, and nostalgia**.

It features a locked **leather envelope** that can only be opened by breaking a **red wax seal**. Inside, the user finds a multi-page letter written on aged **"Kagaz" (parchment)**, complete with ink-style typography and a warm, romantic vignette atmosphere.

### ✨ Features

- **✉️ Rustic Leather Envelope:** A CSS-styled envelope that mimics the look of old brown leather.
- **🕯️ Wax Seal Interaction:** The envelope body is locked; users must click the specific "Open Here" wax seal button to trigger the animation.
- **📜 "Kagaz" Paper UI:** The letter opens in a scrollable modal styled like aged parchment with notebook lines, inner shadows, and a vintage texture.
- **✒️ Classic Typography:** Uses `Playfair Display` and `Dancing Script` to create an authentic handwritten ink effect.
- **📱 Mobile Optimized:** The envelope and letter scale perfectly for all screen sizes, with touch-friendly buttons.
- **❤️ Ambient Atmosphere:** Features a sepia-toned background and floating vintage-colored hearts.

### ⚙️ How It Works

1. **The Arrival:** The page loads with a sealed envelope. Clicking the envelope body does nothing (it's locked!), prompting the user to find the seal.
2. **The Unboxing:** Clicking the **"OPEN HERE"** wax seal triggers a smooth CSS transition: the flap lifts, and the teaser letter slides out.
3. **The Reading:** Clicking "Read More" fades the envelope and opens the full 3-page letter on vintage paper with "Next/Previous" navigation.
4. **The Response:** The final page asks the question, and closing the letter confirms the "Yes!" with a sweet alert.
